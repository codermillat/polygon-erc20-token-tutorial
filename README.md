Polygon ERC20 Token Tutorial

This repository contains the code for building your own ERC20 token on the Polygon (formerly Matic) network. Follow the steps below to understand how to deploy your custom ERC20 token on Polygon.

Prerequisites:

- Familiarity with Solidity programming language.
- An understanding of Ethereum and ERC20 tokens.
- Access to a development environment for writing and testing Solidity smart contracts.
- An account on the Polygon network.

Getting Started:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   git clone https://github.com/codermillat/polygon-erc20-token-tutorial/

2. Navigate to the cloned repository:

   cd polygon-erc20-token-tutorial

3. Review the solidity code in the 'contracts' directory. This repository contains a basic ERC20 token implementation in Solidity.

4. Customize the ERC20 token according to your requirements by modifying the 'ERC20.sol' file. You can change parameters such as the token name, symbol, initial supply, and decimals.

5. Deploy your custom ERC20 token on the Polygon network. You can use tools like Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat for deployment. Ensure that you have the necessary Polygon network configuration set up in your deployment environment.

6. Interact with your deployed ERC20 token using web3 libraries or other Ethereum development tools.

ERC20 Token Details:

The 'ERC20.sol' file contains the implementation of the ERC20 token. Here are some details about the token:

- Name: MILLAT
- Symbol: MLT
- Initial Supply: 100,000,000
- Decimals: 18

Feel free to modify these details according to your token requirements.
